# Dreamerly iOS SDK

### Everything you need to implement and manage in-app NFT purchases and transactions.

Dreamerly is a mobile-native, app store-compliant, and fully customizable suite of toolkits for iOS developers to integrate NFT and web3 features into their apps.

- Enable in-app NFT purchases that are fully compliant with app store guidelines
- Configure, mint, and transfer NFTs from the Dreamerly Dashboard
- Have a single source of truth to sync in-app purchases with blockcchain transactions
- See customer transaction history, NFT-related metrics, and important business indicators
- Get notified of real-time events through webhooks
